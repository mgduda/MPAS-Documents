This chapter describes the io system used in the MPAS models. 

\section{Blah blah blah}
\label{sec:io_overview} 

For quasi-uniform meshes, very little preparation is actually needed, and
generally, one only needs to prepare mesh decomposition files --- files that
describe the decomposition of the SCVT mesh across processors --- when running
MPAS-A using multiple MPI tasks. The procedure for creating these mesh
decomposition files is described in the first section.
